# DECISIONS — Phase 1

Conservative choices made where `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` / `phase-1-prompt.md` left a detail
unspecified or where two authoritative sources conflicted. Per work-mode rule: pick the most
conservative reasonable option, record it here, continue.

## D1 — Design tokens: rendered design system wins over prose palette
`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` §16 (prose) lists primary `#1e40af`, active `#eff6ff`, hover `#f4f2fc`,
border `#dad9e3`. The **rendered** reference `ref/screens/design-system.png` (a screenshot — the
primary visual source of truth per §17.1) publishes a complete, internally-consistent token set
with primary **`#2540C8`**, and `login.png` + `sidebar.png` were clearly built from it.
Because the binding DoD is "נראה לפי reference" (matches the pixels), we adopt the full
design-system token set. Primary `#2540C8`, dark `#1C2E9A`, App BG `#F1F3F8`, Surface `#FFFFFF`,
Field `#EFF2FB`, Line `#E7EAF1`, Ink `#182233`, Muted `#6B7385`, Faint `#9AA1B4`, Hover `#F2F4F8`.
Status colors from the same sheet feed `lookup_items` colors.

## D2 — Font: Assistant (not Noto Sans Hebrew)
Overview §3 prose says "Noto Sans Hebrew". The committed scaffold (`app/layout.tsx`) and the
rendered `design-system.png` ("גופן יחיד: Assistant") both specify **Assistant (Google Fonts)**.
Two concrete sources agree; keep Assistant.

## D3 — Icons: lucide-react via single mapper
Overview §3 names `lucide-react` through one mapper `components/shared/Icon.tsx`; the design sheet
displays Material Symbols glyphs. We use **lucide-react** (overview's explicit implementation
choice, React-native, no icon-font CDN) and pick the closest lucide glyph per reference icon.

## D4 — DB isolation: `guesthub` schema in the shared `postgres` DB
The committed migration (`db/migrations/000_init_schema.sql`) creates a **`guesthub` schema**
(not a separate database). All tables live there. Supabase Auth (`auth.users`) shares the same
`postgres` DB, so `guesthub.users.auth_user_id` can reference it. App connects with porsager
`postgres` through the Supavisor **session** pooler (`localhost:5432`).

**Schema qualification (not `search_path`):** the Supavisor pooler drops the `search_path` startup
param, and — critically — the shared `postgres` DB's `public` schema already hosts **another
project** (mail/invoice) with colliding table names (`users`, `roles`, `permissions`,
`lookup_items`, `audit_logs`). Setting a role-level `search_path` would shadow and break it. So the
guesthub app **fully qualifies every table** (`guesthub.<table>`) and never mutates the shared role.

## D5 — Migration executed via `docker exec supabase-db psql`
Direct, reliable DDL path (the raw Postgres port is not published to the host; only the pooler is).
Seed inserts run through the pooler with porsager.

## D6 — Auth users created via GoTrue Admin API (signup disabled)
`GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true`, so the 4 seed users are provisioned with the service-role key via
`supabase.auth.admin.createUser` (email confirmed), then linked into `guesthub.users.auth_user_id`.
Login accepts **email or username**: a non-email input is resolved to its email server-side, then
`signInWithPassword`. Seed password (dev only): `Guesthub!2026`.

## D7 — Seed users = 4 key roles
6 system roles seeded (`super_admin, admin, manager, receptionist, staff, cleaner`); 4 users, one
each for **manager, receptionist, staff, cleaner** (§20 "one per key role"). The proof login is the
manager, whose role carries broad business permissions so the full shell renders.

## D8 — Money `numeric(12,2)`, dates `date`, times `time`, IDs `uuid` (`gen_random_uuid()`).
`reservation_number` is per-tenant running, generated in seed as `tenant_seq` integers rendered as
text (`unique(tenant_id, reservation_number)`); a real running allocator is a Phase-4 concern.

## D9 — Sidebar shows the full nav from `sidebar.png`, but only Phase-1 routes navigate
Phase 1 builds no business screens. Implemented routes: `/dashboard` (empty placeholder) and
`/housekeeping/my-tasks` (cleaner placeholder, no shell). Every other nav item renders per the
reference but is inert (no `href`) so the shell matches the picture without dead 404 links.
The reference's numeric badges (הזמנות `3`, אישור בקשות `5`) are **omitted** — real counts belong
to their modules and fabricating them would violate the no-mock-data rule (§4.9/§23).

## D10 — Overlaps in seed are valid data
§20 requires overlapping reservations. Two **blocking** reservations never share a room+date range
(that would be invalid double-booking). Overlaps are created as blocking-vs-`cancelled` on the same
room, and back-to-back (checkout day = next check-in day), exercising the availability rule honestly.

## D11 — Single pnpm lockfile
The scaffold shipped `package-lock.json` (npm) but the DoD uses `pnpm`. Standardized on pnpm;
removed `package-lock.json` in favor of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## D12 — guesthub schema is NOT exposed to PostgREST; anon/authenticated revoked
The initial scaffold migration granted `anon`/`authenticated` full privileges and its comment
suggested exposing the schema via `PGRST_DB_SCHEMAS`. Since the app talks to Postgres **only**
through porsager as the owning `postgres` role, those grants were pure attack surface — with the
public anon key they let anyone read/write every tenant's data via `/rest/v1` (verified live during
review). The migration now `REVOKE`s all privileges from `anon`/`authenticated` (grants to
`service_role` only), and the live DB was hardened the same way (anon probes now return 401).
Tenant isolation is enforced solely server-side via `actor.tenantId`. If PostgREST exposure is ever
required, it must come with RLS + tenant-scoped policies on every table.

## D13 — Session-without-active-user is signed out (no redirect loop)
The Edge middleware only knows the GoTrue session; `getActor()` additionally requires an active
`guesthub.users` row. A valid session with no active user (deactivated, unlinked, or a foreign
GoTrue user from the shared auth) would otherwise loop `/login ↔ /`. Such a state now redirects to
`/auth/signout`, which clears the session and returns to `/login`; `loginAction` also rejects +
signs out an authenticated-but-inactive user at login time.
